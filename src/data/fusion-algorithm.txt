The algorithm for determining the result of fusing MonsterA with MonsterB
If the two demons are different races:
    1. Let LvlA = the level of MonsterA,
    Let RaceA = the race of MonsterA,
    and do similarly for MonsterB 
    2. Look up from the fusion table what race you'll get when RaceA fuses with RaceB. Refers to this as RaceR.
    3. Look up and find all of the levels of demons that can be found in RaceR. Put those levels into an array sorted from lowest to highest. Refers to this array as LvlsR.
    4. Create another array called BinsB. Go through each element in LvlsR, apply the calculation 2x-1-LvlA to it, and stores the result into BinsB.
    5. Find the first element in BinsB that is greater than or equal to LvlB. Get its index and refers to this as BinB. If no such element, set the index to the last index.
    6. LvlsR[BinB] is the level of the resulting demon. Refers to this as LvlR.
    7. Look up the demon that has LvlR and RaceR from the compendium.
If the two demons are the same race:
    1. They'll turn into an elemental demon. Just look up what that elemental demon is from the fusion table.
